# RunesBot
A Twitch.tv bot that handles custom channel point rewards and uses the Riot Games API to retrieve live game rune information. 
Also a bunch of scripts for extracting data from the LOL match history API.

# Setup
1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Open cmd in this folder
3. Enter "npm i" to install package dependencies
4. Enter "node league_handler.js interactive" for match history data extraction

You can also run the Twitch and Discord bots if you are brave but you will have to fill in a lot of API keys / auth tokens etc.
